# Polynomial-Regression

Our hypothesis function need not be linear if it does not fit the data well.
We can change the behaviour or curve of our hypothesis by making it quadratic,cubic or square root.


In the above example, we loaded the Boston data set from sklearn and performed Linear Regression without modifying the features.

And then in the second step we modified the features to Polynomial with a degree of 2 and then applied Linear Regression.

The r2- score value also shows an increase in value with decrease in the root mean square error.
